# Pyramid Pattern Programs in JavaScript

This repository contains multiple pyramid pattern implementations written in JavaScript.
The purpose of this repository is to demonstrate **progressive improvement in logic, structure, and code readability** while practicing core JavaScript fundamentals.

---

## 📚 Implemented Patterns

The following pyramid patterns are included:

- **Pyramid Stars**  
  Basic pyramid pattern using loops.

- **Reverse Pyramid**  
  Inverted pyramid structure using nested loops.

- **Pyramid Using `repeat()` Method**  
  Improved readability and cleaner logic using JavaScript string methods.

- **Hollow Pyramid**  
  Pattern with conditional logic to create hollow structure.

- **Hollow Pyramid Using Functions**  
  Refactored version focusing on:
  - Code reusability
  - Separation of concerns
  - Better structure and maintainability

---

## 🎯 Learning Objectives

This repository focuses on improving:

- Loop control and nested loops
- Conditional logic
- String manipulation
- Function-based design
- Refactoring for readability and reuse
- Writing cleaner and maintainable code

Each implementation reflects a **step forward from the previous one**.

---

## 🧠 Why Multiple Versions?

Different versions of similar patterns are intentionally kept to:

- Show logical evolution
- Compare approaches
- Practice refactoring
- Build a strong foundation for problem solving

This mirrors real-world development where code is continuously improved rather than rewritten once.

## ▶️ How to Run

Make sure Node.js is installed.

```bash
node <filename>.js
